# dotfiles
This is my personal setup with configuration files for:
- bspwm
- urxvt
- polybar

# Prerequisites
Fira Code Nerd Font is used in urxvt and polybar, Rofi is the default application launcher.

All folders go to `~/.config` and Xresources should be moved to `~/.Xresources`

Make sure to run:
```
xrdb ~/.Xresources
```
for the changes in urxvt to take effect
